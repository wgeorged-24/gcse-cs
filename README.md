## 📘 GCSE Computer Science – Priority 3 Interactive Resources

Welcome to this collection of **interactive learning resources** designed to support your revision and understanding of **Priority 3 topics**.

These topics are sometimes referred to as **High Rotational Topics** and are **likely to be assessed in 2026**.

---

## ⭐ Why these topics matter

GCSE Computer Science exams often follow a **rotational pattern**.

This means that topics not heavily assessed in recent years are more likely to appear in future exam papers.

Examiners often take a **“leapfrog” approach**, where the focus moves forward based on:
- Previous exam coverage
- Topic weighting
- Specification balance

The topics in this collection:
- Have not featured heavily in recent papers
- Are due to return in upcoming exams
- Often appear as **higher-mark or application-based questions**

Spending time on these areas is a **smart revision strategy**.

## 🧠 How to use these resources

Each resource is:
- Interactive  
- Self-paced  
- Designed to build understanding, not memorisation  

**Recommended approach:**
1. Work through one topic at a time  
2. Read explanations carefully  
3. Use interactive elements to check your understanding  
4. Repeat activities until you feel confident  

You can return to these resources as often as you like.
