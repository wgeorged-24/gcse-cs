📘 GCSE Computer Science – Priority 3 Interactive Resources

Welcome to this collection of interactive learning resources designed to support your revision and understanding of Priority 3 topics.

These topics are sometimes referred to as High Rotational Topics and are very likely to be assessed in 2026.

⭐ Why these topics matter

GCSE Computer Science exams often follow a rotational pattern.
This means that topics not heavily assessed in recent years are more likely to appear in future papers.

Examiners often use a “leapfrog” approach, where question focus jumps forward based on:

Previous exam coverage

Topic weighting

Specification balance

The topics in this collection:

Spending time on these areas is a smart revision strategy.
